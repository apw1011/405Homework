  <h2>Reflection</h2>

  <p>Class went well, and I purchased my first lap top in my life by the second week.  I love how powerful this little machine is.
    All the other kids always had one, and I would be on a big clumsy office box, and I finally humbled up and got a computer in my home,
    on the internet, and a lap top.  I feel much better, and I don't know why I put this move off for so long.  So to begin with, I was behind.
    Yet I have learned to retain grounding, and I caught right up.  In Class the lesson went well.  I was able to pay attention thanks to
     having the lap top.  I need to remember to bring my glasses.  I finished the first homework on time, and the second one has two values
    for me.  I'm psyched, and afraid I will get stuck.  I know I need to tap on slack in case I get lost.
  </p>
  <p>HTML is fun, and i have not tried CSS yet.  Homework two has a lot of CSS so I expect to pay attention in class, and wing it for
     the whole week.  Homework starts the very next day and I will be working on this all week end.  I am having a lot of fun.  Thanks
     for the lesson.      Alfred     apw1011
