    <p>Aland Motors will be run by me, and I will have friends willing to help me to sell cars.  I plan that it should be an LLC after a couple of cars
      are sold.  It is my dream to own some property in or near Manchester, a property where I could build a showroom to house and sell the cars.
      I would have to sell alot of cars to be able to afford this luxury.  So I have to start small, and sell one car at a time.  If the venture
      is profitable, I could restore two at one time.  I will be working, so funds can come from my personal account as well.</p>

  <div class="setup">
    <p>Buying cars for restoration will be a pleasurable experience.  I plan on doing very much research on each car that is in consideration.  It
      is important to analyze the car's condition, so I can know how much it is worth.  And then if the price is right, we will buy the car. I
      plan on searching two markets for the cars that we can restore.  I will check the Auto Trader and I will check the Craigs List.  And I will
      look up their values at a site called Hemmings Motor News.</p>
