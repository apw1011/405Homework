    <p>Aland Motors will be run by me, and I will have friends willing to help me sell cars.  I plan that it should be an LLC after a couple of cars
      are sold.  It is my dream to own some property in or near Manchester, a property where I could build a showroom to house and sell the cars.
      I would have to sell alot of cars to be able to afford this luxury.  So i have to start small, and sell one car at a time.  If the venture
      is profitable, I could restore two at one time.  I will be working, so funds can come from my personal account as well.</p>
