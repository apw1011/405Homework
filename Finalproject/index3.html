    <p>Once we have acquired the unrestored cars, and gotten them to our possession in New Hampshire, the work begins.  We will have to choose
      between 36 restoration places whom offer their services in New Hampshire.  Some are better than others, and we will only know this on a
      trial and error basis.  I plan on getting three estimates for the first one, and checking out their garage at the same time.  And then I
      plan on taking the lowest offer with a suitable set up.  And then the cars will be brought to new.</p>
