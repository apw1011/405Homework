    <p>Once we have acquired the unrestored cars, and gotten them to our possession in New Hampshire, the work begins.  We will have to choose
      between 36 restoration places whom offer their services in New Hampshire.  Some are better than others, and we will only know this on a
      trial and error basis.  I plan on getting three estimates for the first one, and checking out their garage at the same time.  And then I
      plan on taking the lowest offer with a suitable set up.  And then the cars will be brought to new.</p>

    <p>To pick out the restoration place, one must talk to them about what kind of cars they most often restore, and this should narrow the
      search down a great deal.  Then after the estimates, the lowest price wins, and there it goes into restoration.  It might be wise to do
      the body work and the engine work in two separate places.  This depends on the body shop's capabilities.  I think for the Corvette, my
      first, I will get the engine tuned up first, and then the whole car restored.  And this all costs money, which makes it an investment.</p>
