    <p>I have waited a long time with a dream of selling cars.  The cars are fun to buy, and fun to restore, yet it will be more difficult
      to sell them.  I have a plan.  I have restored two cars before, and the cost was way less than the ending value for both.  If this is
      again the case, I will ask for a percentage of cost above the cost as a sales price, which will take no more than 10% home.  Then the
      profit margin will both pay the employees, and strengthen the business.  I want to sell all the cars below value.</p>

    <p>So this project is in the plan stage of becoming a real business for me.  I hope to have great success selling cars.  Below I have
      added a form that you can fill out to get in touch with me about the car business.  I ask you your name, your phone number, and
      your e-mail address.  Then I ask you if you have any cars that you would like to sell, cars that are not restored yet.  Thank you
      for your gracious time spent exploring my dream project, and hopefully soon a real venture.</p>
