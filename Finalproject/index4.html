    <p>I have waited a long time with a dream of selling cars.  The cars are fun to buy, and fun to restore, yet it will be more difficult
      to sell them.  I have a plan.  I have restored two cars before, and the cost was way less than the ending value for both.  If this is
      again the case, I will ask for a percentage of cost above the cost as a sales price, which will take no more than 10% home.  Then the
      profit margin will both pay the employees, and strengthen the business.  I want to sell all the cars below value.</p>
