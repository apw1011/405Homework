      <p>Welcome to the web site dedicated for the hopes of opening a business, a good business named Aland Motors.  This is a car sales organization
        which promises that all cars for sale have been fixed to as perfect as we could manage from where we found these cars.  All of our cars
        must be restored to close to original shape.  We will not sell a car that we have not actually restored.</p>
