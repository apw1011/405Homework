      <p>Welcome to the web site dedicated for the hopes of opening a business, a good business named Aland Motors.  This is a car sales organization
        which promises that all cars for sale have been fixed to as perfect as we could manage from where we found these cars.  All of our cars
        must be restored to close to original shape.  We will not sell a car that we have not actually restored.</p>

      <p>I hope to begin business with the help of the two cars shown above, both of which resemble cars that I own.  The blue 1954 Chevy is fully restored
        and ready for use.  However I did not restore this car, so I will keep it and not sell it.  I bought the red Corvette in the year 1999, and it is
        in good unrestored condition.  It needs a spanking, and here, I have the first car sale for Aland Motors.</p>

      <p>The investment will come from the trust fund set for me by my parents, and again, at the permission of my parents.  I will restore the Vette first,
        an investment that I am 13000 into.  it doesn't need much, yet a fully restored 1974 Corvette is worth near 30000 dollars.  I should break even, and
        the funds will be first allocated in the business.  I could use this to locate another investment, a nice used car that I turn into a classic.</p>
