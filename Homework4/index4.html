          <p class="says">The world's greatest rock bands are touring every year.  They have left for us a web page for us to keep up with them,
            where they go, and when they come near.  Five of these greatest bands are examples above.  They really put on spectacular shows.
              And you can buy tickets to go to the show on line.</p>
          <p class="says">I have been a fan of great music for 30 years.  I have been to very many shows, and they were all good in their own way.
            These musicians have put their energies into making and performing their music and this is the most wonderful thing about living
            in the United States of America, because music is so readily available, and so often performed.</p>
          <p class="says">I have chosen five rock bands whom I would love to see live if they came near.  They have web sites, and just press on
            the link above and you are there.  Also, I have offered links to my two favorite CD stores, Newbury Comics and Bull Moose Music to the
            right.  And if you prefer to buy your music on line for your ipod, computer, or telephone, There is a link to You tube.</p>
          <p class="says">Below is a form for you to fill out so we can keep in touch and go to concerts together.  I ask you of your name,
            your age, and your telephone number.  And then I ask you to list your favorite rock bands.  Then I ask if you are willing to drive.
            We will be in touch, and hopefully we will be able to put things together.</p>

      <p>You have reached the end of my mini web site.  I hope you fill out the form to keep in touch with us.  We like to
        go to shows, trade music, and listen together.  Music is really one of the best parts of my life.  It is very positive.
        Thank you, and hopefully a happy hello in the future.</p>
